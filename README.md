# Artificial Intelligence Module
I completed an Artificial Intelligence module for my BSc in Data Science at York St.John's University. This repository contains the code submitted for that module, demonstrating my experience in developing ML models from the ground up.

This process involved dataset exploration and preparation, the designing, training and evaluation of multiple models and wrapped up with a detailed analysis and conclusion.

The final output was a Jupyter Notebook, structured like an academic report with code integrated and focused on throughout.

## Task
During the module we learnt about different deep learning models, associated concepts and applications. This assessment asked us to use different deep learning models to analyse an NHS dataset of brain scans, helping classify cancer, tumours and aneurysms.

I chose to compare and contrast a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model with a more traditionally suitable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## View my work
### Option 1 (recommended)
The simplest way to view this work is to simple open the notebook file in your Github interface and review the code and its outputs.

### Option 2
Otherwise, you can simple pull my repository and either open the exported HTML version for review, or run the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred platform.
