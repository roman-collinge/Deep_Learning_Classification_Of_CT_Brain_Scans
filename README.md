# Artificial Intelligence Module
I completed an Artificial Intelligence module for my BSc in Data Science at York St.John's University. This repository contains the code submitted for that module, demonstrating my experience in developing ML models from the ground up.

This process involved dataset exploration and preparation, the designing, training and evaluation of multiple models and wrapped up with a detailed analysis and conclusion.

## Task
During the module we learnt about different deep learning models, associated concepts and applications. This assessment asked us to use different deep learning models to analyse an NHS dataset of brain scans, helping classify cancer, tumours and aneurysms.

I chose to compare and contract a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model with a more traditionally suitable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### Option 1
The easiest method is to open this link, opening a JupyterLab instance through mybinder.org. This repository has been optimised to support this JupyterLab instance by providing a Dockerfile to build from and a comprehensive requirements file.

### Option 2
Otherwise, you can simple pull my repository and run the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred platform.
